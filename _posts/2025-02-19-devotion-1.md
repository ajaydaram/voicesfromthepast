# Who Am I?


**Key Scripture: Colossians 2:10**  
“And you have been made complete in Him, who is the head of all rule and authority.”

## Introduction: The Crisis of Identity
Who am I?  
This is one of the deepest questions every human being wrestles with. In today’s world, people try to define themselves in countless ways:
- By achievements – “I am what I do.”
- By social status – “I am what people think of me.”
- By relationships – “I am who I’m connected to.”
- By appearance – “I am how I look.”
- By struggles or sins – “I am my past.”
- By ministry – “I am my service to God.”

Even Christians can fall into this trap. Some find their identity in their spiritual gifts, church roles, or theological knowledge rather than in Christ. But all these identities are fragile—when we fail, lose our status, or face rejection, we’re left feeling empty and lost.

But Colossians 2:10 declares a powerful truth: “You have been made complete in Him.”

## Point 1: The World Offers a False Identity
The world constantly tells us, “Define yourself.”  
It urges people to create their own identity based on feelings, performance, or culture. But this leads to confusion and instability:
1. If identity is based on success, failure will crush us.
2. If identity is based on relationships, rejection will devastate us.
3. If identity is based on appearance, aging will terrify us.
4. If identity is based on feelings, emotions will deceive us.

No earthly identity can satisfy the soul because we were not created to define ourselves—we were created to be defined by God.

## Point 2: Our Identity in Christ—Complete, Not Lacking
Colossians 2:10 says, “You have been made complete in Him.”  
What does it mean to be “complete in Christ”?
1. **We Lack Nothing for Salvation** – We do not need to “add” to Christ’s work through religion, good works, or personal effort (Ephesians 2:8-9).
2. **We Lack Nothing for Acceptance** – We are fully loved and accepted in Christ—not because of what we do, but because of what He has done (Romans 8:1).
3. **We Lack Nothing for Purpose** – Our meaning in life is not in what we achieve, but in belonging to Jesus (Ephesians 2:10).
4. **We Lack Nothing for Security** – If we are in Christ, our identity is eternal and unshakable (John 10:28).

The world says, “Find yourself.” But God says, “You are already complete in Christ.”

## Point 3: How the Gospel Makes This Possible
How do we become complete in Christ? Through the Gospel:
1. **Christ Restores Our True Identity** – Sin distorts who we are, but Jesus redeems us (2 Corinthians 5:17).
2. **Christ Gives Us a New Name** – Instead of “lost,” “guilty,” or “unworthy,” we are now called children of God (John 1:12).
3. **Christ Fulfills Our Deepest Longings** – Everything we seek—love, security, purpose—is found fully in Him (Psalm 73:25).
4. **Christ Replaces Our Self-Definition** – Instead of striving to create an identity, we receive our identity as a gift from God (Galatians 2:20).

Because of Christ, we no longer need to search for significance in anything else.

## Point 4: Living from Our Identity in Christ
If we are already complete in Christ, how should we live?
1. **Stop Striving for Worth in Temporary Things** – Instead of chasing approval, success, or status, rest in what Jesus has done (Matthew 11:28-30).
2. **Let Go of False Labels** – The world may define us by failures, past sins, or weaknesses, but God calls us His beloved (Romans 8:38-39).
3. **Find Satisfaction in Christ, Not Ministry** – Even serving God can become an identity idol, but our worth is not in our work—it is in our relationship with Him (Luke 10:20).
4. **Live with Boldness and Peace** – When we know we are secure in Christ, we don’t fear rejection, failure, or loss (Philippians 4:7).

We don’t have to prove ourselves—we are already fully loved, fully accepted, and fully complete in Jesus.

## Application: Where Are You Finding Your Identity?
- Are you trying to define yourself by success, ministry, or approval from others?
- Are you looking to Christ alone, or are you searching for something more?
- Do you truly believe you are complete in Him?

True peace and purpose come when we stop looking to the world for identity and rest in who we are in Christ.

## Prayer
“Lord, I confess that I have often sought my identity in things that cannot satisfy. But Your Word says I am complete in Christ. Help me to rest in this truth and live from the identity You have given me. Amen.”

## Action Step
Take time today to write down all the ways you have defined yourself apart from Christ. Then, replace each one with what God says about you in Scripture (e.g., “I am loved,” “I am forgiven,” “I am complete in Him”).

## Final Thought
The world says, “You must create your identity.”  
The Gospel says, “Your identity is already complete in Christ.”  
Rest in Him—you lack nothing.
