# Repentance: A Biblical Perspective by A.W Pink and Daram Ajay

## Introduction

Repentance is absolutely necessary to salvation, just as necessary as faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. As Jesus Himself declared, "Except you repent, you shall all likewise perish" (Luke 13:3). The early church recognized this divine truth when they proclaimed, "Then has God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life" (Acts 11:18). The Apostle Paul affirmed this essential principle, writing that "godly sorrow works repentance, not to be repented of" (2 Corinthians 7:10).

In this comprehensive examination, we will explore the profound nature of true repentance, why it remains absolutely necessary in our contemporary age, and how genuine repentance manifests in the life of a believer. We'll establish the biblical foundation for repentance and carefully distinguish between false, superficial repentance and genuine, transformative repentance that leads to salvation.

## The Current Crisis of False Teaching

### 1. Repentance Minimized

A careful comparison of the prominent place given to repentance in the New Testament with the very small place it has in present-day teaching brings to light one of the most significant and solemn "signs of the times." Many modern teachers claim repentance belongs to a past era, being "Jewish," denying that God demands repentance from sinners today. This dangerous teaching directly contradicts Scripture, which declares, "The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance" (2 Peter 3:9).

### 2. Balance Lost

Others, in their recoil from salvation by reformation, have failed to preserve the balance of truth, neglecting scriptures like Proverbs 28:13: "He who covers his sins shall not prosper; but whoever confesses and forsakes them shall have mercy." This imbalance creates a distorted gospel that offers forgiveness without transformation, contradicting the clear teaching that "if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new" (2 Corinthians 5:17).

### 3. Shallow Views

Even where repentance is acknowledged as necessary, only too often the most shallow and superficial views are entertained of what repentance really is. Many assume that if a person sheds tears or appears broken-hearted, this proves a saving work of Divine grace has begun. However, Scripture warns us that "the sorrow of the world produces death" (2 Corinthians 7:10), and we must distinguish between mere emotional responses and genuine spiritual transformation.

## What Is Repentance?

### Change of Mind

The Greek word "metanoeo," most frequently rendered "repent," signifies a change of mind. But saving repentance means far more than a mere change of opinions—it is a changed mind which leads to action, brought about by the Holy Spirit working on the conscience. As Paul explained to the Ephesian elders, he had been "testifying to Jews, and also to Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ" (Acts 20:21), showing that biblical repentance involves a fundamental reorientation of one's thinking toward God.

### Change of Heart

True repentance involves "metamelomai," a change of heart. It is a Spirit-given realization of the exceeding sinfulness of sin and taking sides with God against oneself. It includes a heart approval of God's law and a full consent to its righteous requirements. Ezekiel prophesied God's promise: "I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh" (Ezekiel 36:26).

### Change of Life

"Metanoia" means a change of course of life. Genuine repentance leads to forsaking sin and turning to God. These three aspects—mind, heart, and life—must go together for repentance to be genuine. John the Baptist demanded evidence of this change, challenging those who came to him: "Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance" (Luke 3:8). Jesus similarly taught that a transformed life provides evidence of genuine repentance: "By their fruits you will know them" (Matthew 7:20).

## The Necessity of Repentance

### 1. God's Law Reveals Sin

The necessity of repentance is discovered by contemplation of God's law, for "by the law is the knowledge of sin" (Romans 3:20). Where there is no expounding of God's holy law, there can be no true, deep saving knowledge of sin. The Spirit uses the law to expose the exceeding sinfulness of sin. As Paul testified, "I would not have known sin except through the law. For I would not have known covetousness unless the law had said, 'You shall not covet'" (Romans 7:7).

### 2. Sin Against God's Character

Repentance is necessary because sin is primarily against God's character. "Against You, You only, have I sinned, and done this evil in Your sight" (Psalm 51:4). The great evil of sin consists in its being against an infinitely glorious and worthy God. This understanding transforms our view of sin from merely breaking rules to grieving the heart of a loving Creator. As Joseph recognized when tempted to sin, "How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?" (Genesis 39:9).

### 3. Required Before Pardon

God never pardons impenitent sinners. Throughout Scripture—from Moses to the prophets, from Christ to His apostles—repentance is consistently demanded before forgiveness is granted. "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins" (Acts 2:38). Jesus established this pattern in His earthly ministry, proclaiming, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel" (Mark 1:15).

## The Evil of Sin

### 1. Rebellion Against God

Sin is saying, "I renounce the God who made me; I disallow His right to govern me. I care not what He says to me, what commandments He has given, nor how He expostulates: I prefer self-indulgence to His approval." This rebellious spirit was present from the earliest days of humanity, as God observed before the flood that "every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually" (Genesis 6:5). Isaiah similarly described sin as rebellion: "I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against Me" (Isaiah 1:2).

### 2. Contempt for Divine Authority

Sin is rebellion against the Majesty of Heaven. It is to treat the Almighty with contempt. How vastly different a thing is sin from what the world supposes! How insensible are the unregenerate to the glory of God and that which is due unto Him! The psalmist recognized this when he wrote, "The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God.' They are corrupt, they have done abominable works" (Psalm 14:1). In our modern age, this contempt often manifests in the idolatry of self-determination, where personal freedom is elevated above divine authority.

### 3. Rejection of Divine Love

To be more concerned about pleasing fellow-rebels than to seek the favor of God is turpitude of the blackest dye. The natural man supposes that the great evil of sin consists in its being injurious to us, but the true evil is its offense against an infinitely holy God. As Jeremiah lamented, "Be astonished, O heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid; be very desolate," says the LORD. "For My people have committed two evils: They have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters, and hewn themselves cisterns—broken cisterns that can hold no water" (Jeremiah 2:12-13).

## False Repentance vs. True Repentance

### Trembling Is Not Repentance

Many are deeply stirred by preaching, filled with alarm, and moved to tears, yet this is not true repentance. Felix "trembled" (Acts 24:25) under Paul's preaching but remained unchanged. Emotional responses alone do not constitute repentance. In our emotionally-driven culture, where feelings are often prioritized over truth, this warning is particularly relevant. The writer of Hebrews reminds us that "Esau... found no place for repentance, though he sought it diligently with tears" (Hebrews 12:17).

### Almost Persuaded Is Not Repentance

Being "almost persuaded" like Agrippa (Acts 26:28) is not repentance. A person may give full assent to the gospel, admire it, "receive the Word with joy," yet be only a stony-ground hearer (Matthew 13:20, 21). Jesus warned about this superficial response in His parable of the sower: "But he who received the seed on stony places, this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; yet he has no root in himself, but endures only for a while. For when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles" (Matthew 13:20-21).

### Temporary Humbling Is Not Repentance

Ahab humbled himself before God (1 Kings 21:27-29), yet soon returned to rebellion. Many are afraid of Hell but not of sinning. True repentance involves hatred of sin itself, not merely fear of its consequences. As Solomon observed, "The fear of the LORD is to hate evil" (Proverbs 8:13). In today's prosperity-focused religious landscape, many seek God only for blessings while avoiding the call to holiness.

### Confession Without Change Is Not Repentance

Judas confessed his sins and returned the money (Matthew 27:3-5), yet was not saved. Merely acknowledging wrongdoing without a transformed heart and life is not true repentance. James challenges believers to "be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves" (James 1:22). In our confession-obsessed culture where public apologies abound without genuine change, this distinction remains critical.

## The Nature of True Repentance

True repentance is a supernatural and inward revelation from God, giving a deep consciousness of what I am in His sight, which causes me to loathe and condemn myself, resulting in a bitter sorrow for sin, a holy horror and hatred for sin, and a turning away from or forsaking of sin.

### 1. Transformation
Complete change of heart and life, as described in Ezekiel 36:26-27: "I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgments and do them."

### 2. Restitution
Making amends where possible, following the example of Zacchaeus who declared, "Look, Lord, I give half of my goods to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore fourfold" (Luke 19:8).

### 3. Forsaking Sin
Turning away from evil ways, as Isaiah commanded: "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; let him return to the LORD, and He will have mercy on him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon" (Isaiah 55:7).

### 4. Confession
Acknowledging sin to God, as John assured believers: "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9).

### 5. Godly Sorrow
Grief for offending God, demonstrated by the tax collector who "would not so much as raise his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me a sinner!'" (Luke 18:13).

## The Fruits of True Repentance

### Hatred of Sin

A real hatred of sin as sin, not merely its consequences. Not only of particular sins, but of all sin, and especially self-will. "You shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that you have committed" (Ezekiel 20:43). This self-loathing stands in stark contrast to our culture's emphasis on self-esteem and self-affirmation. David expressed this hatred when he wrote, "I hate every false way" (Psalm 119:104).

### Deep Sorrow

Godly sorrow produces grief from a sense of having offended so infinitely excellent and glorious a Being as God. It is sorrow produced by the Holy Spirit with God as its object, causing us to "weep bitterly" (Matthew 26:75). Paul distinguishes this from worldly sorrow: "For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death" (2 Corinthians 7:10).

### Honest Confession

"He who covers his sins shall not prosper" (Proverbs 28:13). The Spirit-convicted soul acknowledges sins to God without excuses or minimizing. There is no relief for the stricken heart until sins are frankly confessed. The psalmist experienced this when he wrote, "When I kept silent, my bones grew old through my groaning all the day long... I acknowledged my sin to You, and my iniquity I have not hidden" (Psalm 32:3, 5).

### Actual Turning

True repentance leads to abandoning sin. "Whoever confesses and forsakes them shall have mercy" (Proverbs 28:13). If we really hate sin and sorrow over it, we will abandon it in heart's desire and increasingly in life. This turning is both a turning from sin and a turning to God, as Paul commended the Thessalonians: "you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God" (1 Thessalonians 1:9).

## Repentance and God's Law

### 1. The Law Is Holy

"The law is holy, and the commandment is holy, and just, and good" (Romans 7:12). It cannot be otherwise, for God is its Author, and nothing unholy, unjust, or evil could ever proceed from Him. Therefore, such a law can never be altered or repealed. Jesus affirmed this permanence: "Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled" (Matthew 5:18).

### 2. Christ Fulfilled the Law

Christ did not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it. "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill" (Matthew 5:17). He magnified the law (Isaiah 42:21) by expounding its purity, obeying its precepts, and enduring its penalty. As Paul explained, "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us" (Galatians 3:13).

### 3. The Spirit Honors the Law

The Holy Spirit honors the law by pressing upon the sinner its holy demands, using it as a "schoolmaster" to bring him to Christ (Galatians 3:24). He writes the law in believers' hearts (Hebrews 8:10). This fulfills God's new covenant promise: "I will put My laws in their mind and write them on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people" (Hebrews 8:10).

### 4. Grace Through Righteousness

God's grace never reigns at the expense of righteousness but "through righteousness" (Romans 5:21). Divine grace teaches us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, living soberly, righteously, and godly (Titus 2:12). In our permissive age, we must remember that grace is not license to sin but power to live holy lives: "For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age" (Titus 2:11-12).

## Repentance and Faith

Repentance and faith must never be separated. When Jesus spoke to the chief priests about their rejection of John's message, He charged: "you repented not afterward, that you might believe in him" (Matthew 21:32). Repentance acknowledges the justice of God's sentence; faith accepts His mercy through Christ.

### Conviction of Sin

The Holy Spirit first brings conviction of sin, showing the sinner his guilt and condemnation before God's righteous law. This creates awareness of our desperate need for salvation. As Jesus promised concerning the Holy Spirit, "And when He has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment" (John 16:8).

### Genuine Repentance

True repentance follows, where we acknowledge God's righteous judgment against us, take full blame for our sin, and turn from it in heart and purpose. This prepares the heart for saving faith. The prophet Joel called Israel to "rend your heart, and not your garments; return to the LORD your God, for He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness" (Joel 2:13).

### Saving Faith

Faith then embraces Christ as Savior, trusting in His finished work alone for salvation. "Repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ" (Acts 20:21) are inseparable companions. This faith is not mere intellectual assent but wholehearted trust, as Paul explained: "if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved" (Romans 10:9).

## The Permanence of Repentance

Because true repentance springs from a realization of God's excellence and sin's evil, contrition for and hatred of sin is abiding. As we grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord, our repentance deepens, we judge ourselves more thoroughly, and take a lower place before Him.

### 1. Initial Turning

First act of repentance at conversion, when we experience what Peter described on Pentecost: "Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 2:38).

### 2. Deepening Conviction

Growing awareness of sin's evil, as Paul experienced in his spiritual maturity: "This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief" (1 Timothy 1:15).

### 3. Lifelong Process

Repentance is never complete in this life. Our faith is never so complete that we're free from doubts, and our repentance is never so pure that it's free from hardness of heart. Repentance is a lifelong act, requiring daily prayer for deeper conviction and turning. Jesus taught His disciples to pray daily, "Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors" (Matthew 6:12), acknowledging our ongoing need for forgiveness.

Yet repentance is never perfect in this life. Our faith is never so complete that we're free from doubts, and our repentance is never so pure that it's free from hardness of heart. Repentance is a lifelong act, requiring daily prayer for deeper conviction and turning.

## Repentance as a Divine Gift

### 1st: Source of Repentance

True repentance is a gift from God, not something we produce ourselves. Christ has been "exalted to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins" (Acts 5:31). This truth should humble us and cause us to seek repentance as a gift rather than trying to manufacture it ourselves. Peter affirmed this when he recognized God's work among the Gentiles: "Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life" (Acts 11:18).

### 2nd: Work of the Spirit

The Holy Spirit produces repentance in the heart. Without His supernatural operation, no fallen creature would ever truly repent. As Zechariah prophesied, "I will pour on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and supplication; then they will look on Me whom they pierced. Yes, they will mourn for Him as one mourns for his only son" (Zechariah 12:10).

### 3rd: Means of Grace

God uses His Word, preaching, and providences to bring about repentance. "The goodness of God leads you to repentance" (Romans 2:4). In an age where preaching often focuses on self-help rather than sin and salvation, we must remember that God's Word is the primary instrument for producing conviction and repentance: "For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart" (Hebrews 4:12).

Repentance is not something we can work up in ourselves. The carnal mind is "enmity against God" (Romans 8:7) and will not subject itself to God's law. Only a supernatural work of grace can produce genuine repentance. This is why we must seek it as a gift from Christ rather than trying to manufacture it ourselves.

## The Implications of True Repentance

True repentance has profound implications for the believer's life. It recognizes God as an absolutely perfect, infinitely glorious and amiable Being, worthy of supreme love and honor. It acknowledges our disaffection and rebellion as inexcusable and infinitely criminal.

The repentant soul says, "Righteous are You, O Lord, when You speak, and clear when You judge." It stands opposed to all former prejudices against God's character and to the sin-extenuating, self-justifying disposition that reigns in every impenitent heart. As David confessed, "Against You, You only, have I sinned, and done this evil in Your sight—that You may be found just when You speak, and blameless when You judge" (Psalm 51:4).

In our relativistic age, where moral standards are constantly shifting, true repentance anchors us in the unchanging righteousness of God. It produces a heart that agrees with God's assessment of sin rather than making excuses or minimizing wrongdoing. In the words of Job, "I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees You. Therefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes" (Job 42:5-6).

## Warnings Against False Teaching

Those who teach that repentance is not essential to salvation in this dispensation are "deceivers of souls, blind leaders of the blind." They blankly repudiate Acts 17:30: "But now commands all men everywhere to repent." Such teachers are "ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth" (2 Timothy 3:7).

Equally dangerous are those who turn God's grace into license for sin, claiming the law has been abolished. God's grace never reigns at the expense of righteousness but "through righteousness" (Romans 5:21). Beware of any teaching that minimizes sin or God's holy requirements. Jude warned about such teachers who "turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ" (Jude 4).

In our current religious landscape, be especially wary of:

1. Teaching that claims no repentance is needed for salvation
2. Theology that reduces repentance to merely an emotional response
3. Doctrines that suggest temporary reformation is sufficient
4. Messages that allow for partial repentance rather than complete surrender
5. Claims that God's moral law has been abolished under grace

## Summary: The Essentials of Repentance

### Biblical Foundation

Repentance is an evangelical duty required by God in all dispensations. No preacher is entitled to be regarded as Christ's servant if silent about it. "Repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations" (Luke 24:47). Jesus identified this message as central to the gospel: "Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day, and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem" (Luke 24:46-47).

### Spiritual Nature

True repentance is Spirit-given, involving a change of mind, heart, and life. It includes approval of God's law, hatred of sin, confession to God, and turning from evil. It is never meritorious yet is necessary for saving faith. As Jesus taught, "unless you repent you will all likewise perish" (Luke 13:3). The Apostle Peter similarly proclaimed, "Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord" (Acts 3:19).

### Ongoing Process

Repentance is permanent yet never perfect in this life. It deepens as we grow in grace, leading to greater humility and holiness. We must continually seek it as a gift from Christ, praying daily for deeper repentance. The Apostle Paul models this ongoing posture when he writes, "Not that I have already attained, or am already perfected; but I press on, that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me" (Philippians 3:12).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, repentance is absolutely essential to salvation. Without it, no one will ever truly come to Christ or experience the forgiveness of sins. In our current age of moral relativism, therapeutic spirituality, and cheap grace, the call to genuine repentance is more urgent than ever. As Peter declared on the day of Pentecost, "Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 2:38).

This message remains unchanged across generations and cultures. It is the same call that echoed from the prophets of old, from John the Baptist in the wilderness, from Jesus throughout His earthly ministry, and from the apostles as they established the early church. In every age, including our own, God "now commands all men everywhere to repent" (Acts 17:30).

May God grant us all the gift of genuine, evangelical repentance that leads to life eternal, transforming us into the image of Christ and preparing us for an eternity in His presence. As we embrace this divine gift with humility and gratitude, may we echo the words of the psalmist: "Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me" (Psalm 51:10).
