# THIS WORD FEAR AS TAKEN FOR GOD HIMSELF


## First, let's talk about the word "fear" as it relates to God, who is the object of our fear.

By the word "fear," we are to understand God himself, who is the object of our fear. The divine majesty often goes by this very name. For example, Jacob used this name when he argued with Laban on Mount Gilead after escaping to his father's house. Jacob said, "If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac had not been with me, surely you would have sent me away empty-handed." Later, when Jacob and Laban made a peace covenant, Laban, in his heathen manner, mixed the true God with false gods in his oath, but Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac (Genesis 31:42, 53). By "the Fear," he meant the God of his father Isaac.

God may well be called the Fear of his people, not only because they have, by his grace, made him the object of their fear, but also because of the dread and terrible majesty that is in him. He is a mighty God, great and terrible, and with him is terrible majesty (Daniel 7:28, 10:17; Nehemiah 1:5, 4:14, 9:32; Job 37:22). Who knows the power of his anger? "The mountains quake at him, the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence; yes, the world and all that dwell in it. Who can stand before his indignation? Who can endure the fierceness of his anger? His fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him" (Nahum 1:5-6). 

His people know him and have his dread upon them, which creates and maintains a godly awe and reverence of his majesty that aligns with their profession of him. "Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread." Keep his majesty before the eyes of your soul, and let his excellence make you afraid with godly fear (Isaiah 8:13).

### There are certain things that make God the object of his people's fear.

First, his presence is dreadful, not just his general presence, but even his special, most comforting, and joyous presence. When God comes to bring a soul news of mercy and salvation, even that visit, that presence of God, is fearful. For example, when Jacob went from Beersheba towards Haran, he met with God in a dream, where he saw a ladder set upon the earth reaching to heaven. In this dream, he saw the Lord at the top of the ladder and heard him speak, not with threats or anger, but with sweet and gracious promises of goodness, one after another, about eight or nine in total. Despite all this grace shown in the heavenly vision, Jacob was still filled with dread and fear of God's majesty. When he awoke, he said, "Surely the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it," and he was afraid, saying, "How dreadful is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven" (Genesis 28:10-17).

On another occasion, when Jacob had a memorable encounter with God where he was given the power to prevail and a new name to remind him of God's favor, he still felt such dread of God's majesty that he was amazed his life was preserved (Genesis 32:30). Humans crumble to dust in the presence of God, even when he shows himself in his robes of salvation. We have read how dreadful and terrifying the presence of angels has been to men, even when they brought good news from heaven (Judges 13:22; Matthew 28:4; Mark 16:5-6). If angels, who are mere creatures, are so fearful and terrible in their appearance to men because of the glory God has given them, how much more dreadful and terrible must God himself be to us, who are but dust and ashes?

When Daniel received a vision of his salvation from heaven, the messenger addressed him as "a man greatly beloved," yet the dread and terror of the presence of the one speaking was so overwhelming that Daniel could not stand or bear it. He stood trembling and cried out, "O my lord, because of the vision my sorrows overwhelm me, and I have retained no strength. How can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? For as for me, no strength remains in me" (Daniel 10:16-17). This shows that the presence of God is indeed dreadful and fearful, even in his most gracious and merciful appearances. How much more so when he shows himself to us as one who disapproves of our ways and is offended by our sins?

### There are three main reasons why God's presence is especially fearful to us:

1. **God's Own Greatness and Majesty**: When God reveals his true greatness and majesty to us, it is completely overwhelming. Mortal humans cannot bear such a revelation. John, in the book of Revelation, said, "When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead" (Rev 1:17). Job, too, sought to avoid this overwhelming presence. He said, "Do not let your dread terrify me. Then call, and I will answer; or let me speak, and you reply to me" (Job 13:21-22). Job spoke this way because he understood the terrifying majesty of God. If the presence of an earthly king is intimidating, how much more the presence of the eternal God?

2. **Revealing Our True Selves**: When God is present, his presence causes us to see ourselves more clearly than we ever can by any other means. Daniel said, "My sorrow turned upon me" because the glory of the vision revealed his own sinfulness more clearly (Dan 10:16). He also said, "I was left alone and saw this great vision; no strength remained in me, for my comeliness was turned to corruption, and I retained no strength" (Dan 10:8, 16). God's presence makes even our best qualities seem corrupt. Isaiah experienced this too, saying, "Woe is me, for I am undone! I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts" (Isa 6:5). This wasn't unbelief or slavish fear; it was the glory of God that made Isaiah aware of his own sinfulness.

3. **God's Goodness**: When a sinful creature sees the great God’s goodness and mercy towards them, it makes his presence even more dreadful. Hosea says, "They shall fear the Lord and his goodness" (Hosea 3:5). The goodness and greatness of God create a deep reverence for his majesty. God asks, "Will you not fear me?" (Jer 5:22), and uses one of his mercies as a reason to fear him: "I have set the sand as the boundary for the sea, by a perpetual decree, so that it cannot pass beyond it; though the waves toss themselves, yet they cannot prevail; though they roar, they cannot pass over it" (Jer 5:22). Job, when he experienced God’s presence and saw his goodness, said, "I have heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you. Therefore I abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes" (Job 42:5-6).

The trembling, tears, and brokenness of heart that accompany the pronouncement of the forgiveness of sins are signs of the dread of God’s majesty. When God reveals his goodness, it humbles us and makes us tremble. Some people claim to experience God's presence but act frivolously and without reverence. They act more like performers than serious Christians, showing more respect to earthly authorities than to God. The true presence of God is the most humbling and heart-breaking sight, filled with fear and awe.

**Objection:** But shouldn't we rejoice when we know our sins are forgiven?

**Answer:** Yes, but you should rejoice with trembling, as Psalm 2:11 says. When God truly tells you your sins are forgiven, you will experience both joy and trembling. This happens because, while the guilt is removed, you become more aware of your own filthiness. The realization that such a great God has forgiven someone so filthy makes you both rejoice and tremble. Imagine the blessed confusion and humility you'll feel when, as a vile sinner, you stand before God to receive pardon. As Ezekiel 16:63 suggests, you will remember your shame and be confounded.

**Secondly,** the name of God is also dreadful and fearful. In Deuteronomy 28:58, God's name is described as glorious and fearful. Names distinguish and express the nature of things, and God's name expresses His holy and reverend nature (Psalm 111:9). When He proclaimed His name to Moses in Exodus 34:6-7, it included His attributes of mercy, graciousness, and justice. Therefore, God's name is an object of fear, as David prayed in Psalm 86:11, "Unite my heart to fear your name." God's name is to be feared forever, even by the heathen and kings (Psalm 102:15). The name of God is naturally glorious and incomprehensible, thus making it the object of our fear. We should always have a reverent awe of God whenever we think of or mention His name, especially in religious duties like preaching, praying, or holy conversations. To mention God's name in a light, vain, or profane manner is to take His name in vain, which God will not hold guiltless (Exodus 20:7; Leviticus 20:3).

**Thirdly,** God's worship and service are also dreadful and fearful. David recognized this when he said, "I will come into your house in the multitude of your mercy, and in your fear will I worship toward your holy temple" (Psalm 5:7). He also instructed us to "serve the Lord with fear." Even praising God is a fearful act, as Moses said, "Who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?" (Exodus 15:11). We should rejoice before Him with trembling (Psalm 2:11). All our service to God, and every part of it, should be done with reverence and godly fear. As Paul said, "Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God" (2 Corinthians 7:1; Hebrews 12).
1. **The Worship of God is Fearful:** The worship of God is a fearful thing because it is the worship of God Himself. The level of dread and fear associated with any service depends on the importance or status of the person being served. This can be seen in how subjects serve their princes, servants their lords, and children their parents. Since divine worship is directed to God, and given that God is so great and dreadful in Himself and His name, His worship must therefore be a fearful thing.

2. **God’s Presence in Worship:** This glorious Majesty is present to observe His worshippers as they worship Him. Jesus said, "When two or three of you are gathered together in my name, I am there." This means He is present when people gather to worship Him. Additionally, He is described as walking "in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks" (Revelation 1:13), which refers to the churches. He appears with a countenance like the sun, hair as white as snow, and eyes like a flame of fire. This presence puts dread and fear into His service, and therefore, His servants should serve Him with fear.

3. **God’s Jealousy Over His Worship:** God is particularly jealous about His worship and service. In the Ten Commandments, He mentions His jealousy only in the second commandment, which concerns His worship (Exodus 20). Therefore, be careful about both the matter and manner of your worship, for God says, "I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children." This jealousy puts dread and fear into the worship and service of God.

4. **Judgments for Lack of Godly Fear:** The judgments that God has sometimes executed on those who lacked godly fear while worshipping Him add to the fear and dread of His holy appointments.
   - Nadab and Abihu were burned to death by fire from heaven because they offered unauthorized fire on God's altar. This happened because God demands to be sanctified by those who come near Him (Leviticus 10:1-3). To sanctify His name means to fear and dread Him and to do nothing in His worship that is displeasing to Him. Because these men lacked this fear, they died before the Lord.
   - Eli's sons, who lacked this fear while ministering in God's worship, were both killed in one day by the Philistines (1 Samuel 2).
   - Uzzah was struck dead for touching the ark of the covenant without proper reverence (1 Chronicles 13:9-10).
   - Ananias and Sapphira were struck dead for lying in the church, showing a lack of fear and dread of God's majesty, name, and service (Acts 5).

These examples teach us that, next to God's nature and name, His service and instituted worship are the most dreadful things under heaven. His name is on His ordinances, His eye is on the worshippers, and His wrath and judgment are on those who do not worship Him with fear. This is why some of those in Corinth were cut off by God, and to others, He turned His back, no longer being with them (1 Corinthians 11:27-32).
