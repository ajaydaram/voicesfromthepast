# MONARCHY, ARISTOCRACY, DEMOCRACY
## Joel Beeke & Paul Smalley

CHURCH authority is human authority, though it is divinely instituted. Human authority typically takes the form of monarchy (the rule of one over all), aristocracy (the rule of those regarded as best able to govern), democracy (the rule of the people), or often some combination. John Calvin said, "I will not deny that aristocracy, or a system compounded of aristocracy and democracy, far excels all others."[^1] When we examine the New Testament's teachings about church government, we discover three basic principles that reflect aspects of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, though radically modified by the character and office of Jesus Christ as the Servant of the Lord.

In the church, there should be no selfish and tyrannical monarch but the perfect monarchy of Christ alone; no elitist aristocrats who pass their power and wealth on to their children but the humble aristocracy of ordained servants qualified by their Christlikeness and Spirit-giftedness; and no mob rule driven by the whims of public opinion but the democracy of the saints in submission to Christ and His servants.[^2]

Church government should be shaped by the following principles.

First, Christ rules His church as a mediatorial monarchy. The Lord Jesus Christ is the King of His church, the only Mediator of God's saving reign in the lives of His people. Hence, the church is properly called a monarchy, but it is the monarchy of God the Son incarnate, not any mere man on earth. The church's Great Commission to make disciples of all nations comes from the One Who said, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth" (Mat 28:18-19). The duty of the church consists precisely in this: obeying all that He commanded and teaching others to do the same (v. 20). Though this King ascended into heaven, He is not absent from His people on earth, for He promised, "I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world" (v. 20). Therefore, no mere man is king in Christ's church. The God-man alone is King.

James Bannerman said,

> The Lord Jesus Christ is the only Head of the Church...The Church, as a society, owes its origin to Christ: it derives from Him its government and office-bearers; it receives from Him its laws and constitution; it draws from Him its spiritual influence and grace; it accepts at His hand its ordinances and institutions; it acts in His name and is guided in its proceedings by His authority.[^3]

Some ministers of the seventeenth century stated, "Jesus Christ our Mediator has laid down in His Word a perfect and sufficient rule for the government of His visible church under the New Testament, which all the members of His church ought to observe and submit unto till the end of the world."[^4] That is not to say that every detail of church administration is divinely revealed; rather, as the Westminster Confession of Faith (1.6) states, "There are some circumstances concerning the...government of the Church, common to human actions and societies, which are to be ordered by the light of nature, and Christian prudence, according to the general rules of the Word."

The ascended Christ actively reigns in His church. He appoints the ministers of the Word and works through them to grow the church to maturity (Eph 4:10-16). Whenever a minister preaches the gospel, Christ is speaking through His ambassador (2Co 5:20). He is building His church and granting it the power to overcome the forces of death and evil (Mat 16:18). Christ gives the officers of the church "the keys of the kingdom" to admit or exclude people from its membership (v. 19; 18:18). He rebukes churches that disobey His Word and disciplines churches that do not repent of their disobedience (Rev 2:5, 16, 22-23; 3:3, 19).

Paul says that Christ is the "head" (kephalē) of the church. Christ's headship refers to His sovereign power: God "put all things under his feet" so that He is "the head over all things" (Eph 1:22), "the head of all principality and power" (Col 2:10). Yet there is no tyranny on Christ's part; He exercises His power to graciously save and strengthen His people through their union with Him: "Christ is the head of the church: and He is the saviour of the body" (Eph 5:23), "the Head, from which all the body...increaseth with the increase of God" (Col 2:19; cf. Eph 4:15). Hence, Christ exercises sole mediatorial monarchy over His church. He has supreme authority, and any subsidiary authority in the church comes only by His institution and delegation.

Jeffrey Johnson says, "The church does not have permission to create its own objectives, to carry out its own desires, and function by its own self-made rules. The church has no right to bind the conscience of its membership to manufactured rules and objectives." Negatively, this means, "without Christ, the church has no authority." Positively, "with Christ, the church has authority. Though the church has no authority and power in itself, the church has divine authority and power when it is submissive to God's Word."[^5]

Second, the eldership leads Christ's church as a ministerial aristocracy. This principle protects the first principle from distortion by those who claim to live in submission to King Jesus while embracing radical individualism. Christ's church, over which He reigns by the Word and Spirit, consists of believers united in churches under the ministry of human officers. These men act as shepherds who "feed the flock of God" under the supervision of "the chief Shepherd" (1Pe 5:2, 4). Paul says to them, "Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood" (Act 20:28). These leaders have authority; they are called "them which have the rule over you" (Heb 13:7, 17, 24). Christians must "obey" and "submit" to them (v. 17).

Hence, we may speak of an aristocracy in the church, but we must immediately qualify it as a ministerial aristocracy, which means "the rule of servants." Officers in the church are servants and stewards of the Lord (1Co 4:1-2; Ti 1:7). They are never to use their authority as if they were "lords" over the church (1Pe 5:3), though that is the way of leaders in this world (Mar 10:42-43). Edmund Clowney said, "The church is not like the kingdoms of this world, for it is organized for service, not dominion. All government in the church is stewardship: i.e., its leaders are servant-managers, who use their authority only to advance the interests of those they represent and serve."[^6] Their authority over men's consciences extends only as far as Christ speaks in the Holy Scriptures. Louis Berkhof wrote, "He is ever present in the Church when it meets for worship, and speaks and acts through its officers. It is Christ the King that warrants them in speaking and acting with authority."[^7] Thus, the principle of mediatorial monarchy limits the principle of ministerial aristocracy, so much so that some people might be more comfortable describing the eldership as a "servantocracy."

Elders have real authority but possess no mediatorial or monarchical authority—they are not even mediators or monarchs in their own limited realms. "Church government is either: 1. Magisterial,[^8] lordly, and supreme, and so it is primitively[^9] and absolutely in God (Mat 28:18); dispensatorily[^10] and mediatorial[ly][^11] in Jesus Christ our Mediator only...2. Ministerial, stewardly and subordinate. And this power Jesus Christ our Mediator has committed to His church—guides and officers in His church (2Co 10:8; 13:10)."[^12]

The New Testament refers to ruling church leaders primarily with two terms: "bishop" (episkopos) and "elder" (presbyteros). The word episkopos means "overseer" (Neh 11:14, 22 LXX)—that is, someone who watches over people and goods as a protector or a supervisor (Num 31:14; Jdg 9:28 LXX). Christ is called "the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls" (1Pe 2:25). The office of apostle is called a "bishoprick" or office of oversight (episkopē, Act 1:20; cf. Num 4:16 LXX). However, there is also a particular office in the church, "the office of a bishop" (episkopē, 1Ti 3:1), in which a "bishop" (episkopos) or "overseer" is a man of sound faith and blameless character who teaches and governs the church (vv. 2-5; Ti 1:6-9). God commissions elders/overseers to exercise authority over churches for their good, like fathers over households (1Ti 3:4-5) or shepherds over flocks (1Pe 5:1-4).

In the New Testament, a bishop or overseer of the church is the same as an "elder" (presbyteros). Paul called "the elders of the church" in Ephesus to meet him and said to them, "The Holy Ghost hath made you overseers" (Act 20:17, 28). It was the apostolic practice to ordain "elders in every church" (14:23), and Paul addressed one of his epistles to "the saints in Christ Jesus...with the bishops and deacons" (Phi 1:1), evidently the only office bearers in that church. Paul instructed Titus to "ordain elders in every city" and then told him [about] the qualifications for a "bishop" (Ti 1:5, 7). Peter wrote to "the elders" and commanded them to be "taking the oversight" (episkopeō) of the flock (1Pe 5:1-2). Witherow also noted, "If the offices of bishop and elders were quite distinct—if a bishop were an office-bearer bearing rule over a number of elders, it does seem strange that no passage of Scripture speaks at the same time of bishops and elders."[^13] Hence, we conclude that episkopos and presbyteros pertain to the same office.

The elders govern the church as members of a council of elders (presbyterion, 1Ti 4:14; cf. Luk 22:66; Act 22:5). The New Testament pattern is a plurality of elders in each church because they exercise authority jointly as a body, not as individuals. The apostles ordained "elders in every church" (Act 14:23; cf. Ti 1:5), and we constantly read of them exercising their ministry as a plurality—"the elders of the church" (Jam 5:14).[^14] Similarly, we read of "overseers" (plural episkopoi) in the church in Ephesus (Act 20:28), and so also "bishops" (episkopoi) in Philippi (Phi 1:1). Just as every city in old covenant Israel had elders who ruled over its civil life (Deu 19:12; 21:3-4; 22:15-18), so every local church in new covenant Israel should have elders who rule over its ecclesiastical life.

Therefore, the authority of elders is conciliar—that is, exercised in partnership with the other elders. Each elder is under the authority of the church's eldership as a whole, and by this means, the authority of each overseer is limited by checks and balances. John Murray said, "Elders are not lords over God's heritage; they are themselves of the flock and are to be examples to it...Elders are members of the body of Christ and are subject to the very same rule of which they are the administrators."[^15] There is much more to say about the kinds, qualifications, and functions of elders, but here we simply introduce the basic principle of eldership as Christ's means to govern the church.

Herman Bavinck said,

> Christ alone is the king of the church...From the standpoint of its invisible side, its government is strictly monarchical. And Christ was not only king in the past, but He also is that still. From heaven He governs His church on earth by His Word and Spirit...On the visible side of the church, His government is...aristocratic and presbyterial...By [the office bearers] He takes care of the spiritual and material interests of His church.[^16]

Third, Christ's church regulates itself as a mutually accountable democracy. The democratic principle of church government is based on the common profession of faith by church members and the priesthood of all believers (1Pe 2:5, 9), who each have access to God through Christ (Eph 3:12; Heb 10:19-22). A fundamental unity and equality are shared by all who are in Christ (Gal 3:28; Col 3:11). Hence, they share the responsibility to exhort and encourage one another to repent of sin, obey God, and do good works.[^17] The democratic principle balances the aristocratic principle in Christ's church, prohibiting the eldership from asserting itself as a class of kings or priests over the people, standing as mediators between them and the Lord, and claiming to be exempt from exhortation by or accountability to the people. Furthermore, the eldership also practices a kind of democracy in holding each officer accountable to all the elders in the church.

Therefore, in Christ's church, we see the principles of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy all operating together. William Ames said, "The form of this polity is altogether monarchical in respect to Christ as the king and the head. But in respect to the visible system of administration, it is of a mixed nature: partly aristocratic, so to speak, and partly democratic."[^18] However, the way these elements come together in the church is unique, given the special character of the kingdom of God. All church authority comes from God through Christ and is rightly used in obedience to His Word by the power of the Holy Spirit.

[^2]: Francis Turretin (1623-1687) said, "It is not controverted whether any government should be established in the church.... Rather the question is what that is and what is its nature: monarchical or aristocratic. The question is not whether in the church any monarchy may have a place to which all men should submit from the necessity of salvation. For this no one denies to be proper to Christ, who was constituted by God the head and supreme King of His church, Who governs it monarchically." Turretin then quoted Luke 22:25-26 and 1Peter 5:2-3, saying, "In both passages, domination in the church is prohibited and only ministry and service are left." Institutes, 18.16.2-4 (3:146-47).
