# Regeneration, or the New Birth

## Introduction: The Divine Transformation

Regeneration is that miraculous work of God which fits a fallen creature to fulfill his chief duty: glorifying his Maker. As Scripture declares, "For you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body" (1 Corinthians 6:20). In our modern age of self-fulfillment and personal autonomy, this fundamental truth remains unchanged: we were created for God's glory, not our own.

Two insurmountable obstacles stand in the way of man's salvation: bondage to the guilt and penalty of sin, and bondage to the power and presence of sin. As Christ declared, "with men this is impossible." But He added, "with God all things are possible" (Matthew 19:26). In today's world of technological advancement and human achievement, we easily forget our spiritual helplessness before God.

The first obstacle is overcome through Christ's mediatorial work, while the second is accomplished by the Holy Spirit's operations. One takes place when faith lays hold of Christ and receives pardon; the other occurs gradually through regeneration, sanctification, and glorification. "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come" (2 Corinthians 5:17).

In regeneration, indwelling sin receives its death-wound, though not its death. This Divine work is profoundly mysterious, like the wind that "blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit" (John 3:8).

## The Necessity of Regeneration

### 1. Natural Degeneration

In consequence of the fall, we are born alienated from Divine life and holiness. Ezekiel describes our spiritual plight as being "cast out to the loathing of our persons" (Ezekiel 16:5). The very fountain of our being is polluted, continually sending forth bitter springs. "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?" (Jeremiah 17:9). There are only two spiritual states: life or death, righteousness or sin, light or darkness. In our modern world of moral relativism, this binary reality is often rejected, yet remains divinely true.

### 2. Total Depravity

Every part of man's being has been corrupted by sin. His heart is "deceitful above all things and desperately wicked," his mind blinded by Satan and darkened by sin, his affections prostituted, and his will enslaved from good and opposed to God. "None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God" (Romans 3:10-11). He cannot better himself, for he is "without strength" (Romans 5:6). In our age of self-improvement and personal development, this biblical diagnosis remains accurate – we cannot regenerate ourselves.

### 3. Unsuitedness to God

Man in his fallen state cannot enter God's kingdom without a spiritual nature. There can be no communion between light and darkness, between the living God and a dead heart. "What fellowship has light with darkness?" (2 Corinthians 6:14). "Can two walk together, except they be agreed?" (Amos 3:3). God loathes sin, man loves it; God loves holiness, man loathes it. Our contemporary culture celebrates tolerance and inclusivity, yet fails to recognize that unholiness cannot dwell with the Holy One.

## The Unfitness of Man for Heaven

### 1. Spiritual Death

Man is spiritually dead and needs almighty power to make him alive. "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men" (Romans 5:12). Every child is born entirely destitute of spiritual life, and therefore must be born again to enter God's kingdom. "You were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked" (Ephesians 2:1-2). Despite our technological prowess and scientific advancement, we remain spiritually lifeless apart from divine regeneration.

### 2. Inability to Please God

Without regeneration, man cannot perform Gospel duties. Pride was the Devil's condemnation, and our first parents fell through aspiring to be like God. Man is too well-opinionated of himself to perform duties in an evangelical strain with the nothingness the Gospel requires. "Those who are in the flesh cannot please God" (Romans 8:8). Our achievement-oriented society values self-sufficiency and personal accomplishment, yet before God, we must acknowledge our complete dependence.

### 3. Unfitness for Heaven

Heaven is a prepared place for a prepared people. The natural man cannot love spiritual things. "The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned" (1 Corinthians 2:14). The man himself must be changed before he is prepared for Heaven. "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God" (Matthew 5:8). This change must take place here on earth. In an age of instant gratification, we must understand that spiritual preparation cannot be postponed or rushed.

## The Supreme Glory of Heaven

### The Manifestation of Holiness

Heaven's supreme glory is not freedom from suffering, but the full manifestation of Him who is "glorious in holiness" (Exodus 15:11). Its inhabitants are given clear sight of God's ineffable purity and granted intimate communion with Him. "Now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face" (1 Corinthians 13:12). In our comfort-seeking society, we must reorient our understanding of heaven as primarily about God's glory, not our happiness.

### The Necessity of Transformation

None are fitted for heaven unless their inner being has undergone a radical, revolutionizing, supernatural change. "Unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God" (John 3:3). The instrument of the heart must be tuned here on earth to produce the melody of praise in Heaven. Our consumerist culture often views heaven as a destination to be earned or achieved, but Scripture reveals it as the dwelling place of the transformed.

### The Inseparability of Justification and Sanctification

Many suppose only Christ's merits are needed to qualify them for Heaven. But this is a mistake. None receive remission of sins who are not first "turned from the power of Satan unto God" (Acts 26:18). Pardoning sins and purifying the heart are inseparable. "Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity" (2 Timothy 2:19). Contemporary "easy believism" often separates what God has joined together – forgiveness and transformation.

## The Nature of Regeneration

### 1. Spiritual Transformation

Regeneration is the commencement of a new experience so revolutionizing that one becomes a "new creature" (2 Corinthians 5:17). It is God's answer to the fall. No faculty was lost when man fell, but all were corrupted by the introduction of sin. In our digital age of virtual realities, we must recognize that spiritual transformation is thoroughly real and affects our entire being.

### 2. New Principle of Life

What takes place at regeneration is the reversing of what happened at the fall. Just as spiritual death came through the entrance of evil, spiritual life comes through the introduction of a principle of holiness. God communicates a new principle as real as sin. "I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh" (Ezekiel 36:26). Despite modern skepticism about spiritual realities, this divine implantation remains as necessary today as ever.

### 3. Transformation of the Person

It is a person, not merely a "nature," who is born of the Spirit. The same person who was spiritually dead is now made spiritually alive. "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit" (John 3:6) is not something substantial added, but that which spiritualizes all inward faculties. "You have put off the old self with its practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator" (Colossians 3:9-10). In our identity-obsessed culture, true identity transformation comes through regeneration.

## The Elements of Regeneration

### 1. Impartation

God communicates something to the one born again: a principle of faith and obedience, a holy nature, eternal life. "His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness" (2 Peter 1:3). In our age of information overload, this divine impartation is the most crucial knowledge we can receive.

### 2. Renovation

God renews every faculty of the soul and spirit, enabling them to be exercised upon spiritual objects. "Be renewed in the spirit of your minds" (Ephesians 4:23). Our innovation-focused world celebrates the new, yet the most profound renovation occurs when God transforms our inner being.

### 3. Subjugation

God subdues the power of indwelling sin. He does not eradicate it but dethrones it, so it no longer has dominion. "Sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace" (Romans 6:14). In a culture that celebrates uninhibited self-expression, the subjugation of sinful desires stands as a countercultural reality.

Regeneration is not the improvement of the "flesh," which remains with the believer. The appetites of the flesh remain the same after new birth, but they no longer reign. The renewed soul soon discovers the flesh is still alive, desiring to have its way, but grace will not allow it to rule. "For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do" (Galatians 5:17).

## The Divine Power in Regeneration

### 1. God's Mysterious Working

We cannot fully explain how God's power acts upon us, how He cleanses the unclean and subdues the wolf so it dwells with the lamb. Yet both Scripture and experience testify to these facts. "The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit" (John 3:8). God's power in regeneration is of the same kind as His operation in providence. In our scientific age that demands rational explanations, we must acknowledge the mystery of God's sovereign work.

### 2. Mighty Transformation

God's grace produces evident effects: the thoughtless are made to think seriously, the careless become concerned with eternal interests, blasphemers learn to pray, the proud become penitent, and the worldly set their affections on heavenly inheritance. "We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works" (Ephesians 2:10). In our metrics-driven society, the transformative effects of regeneration remain the most compelling evidence of divine power.

### 3. Divine Image Restored

The regenerated are made "partakers of the divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4) - not of God's essence, but recipients of inherent grace with the lineaments of the divine image stamped upon the soul. It is a "changing" into Christ's image, like His transfiguration where His countenance was irradiated by new light. "And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another" (2 Corinthians 3:18). In our image-conscious culture, this divine resemblance represents true beauty.

## Biblical Descriptions of Regeneration

Scripture uses numerous figures to describe regeneration: being "drawn" to Christ (John 6:44), the heart being "opened" (Acts 16:14), eyes being opened and turning from darkness to light (Acts 26:18), casting down imaginations and bringing thoughts captive to Christ (2 Corinthians 10:5), being "light in the Lord" (Ephesians 5:8), and God's laws written on our hearts (Hebrews 8:10).

Each image reveals different aspects of this miraculous work. Together they help us understand the nature of that divine operation which enables believers to live unto God. "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them" (Ephesians 2:10). In our visually-oriented society, these biblical metaphors provide powerful ways to conceptualize spiritual reality.

## The Effects of Regeneration: Illumination

### Spiritual Light

As in creation, God commands light to shine in our hearts. "For God, who said, 'Let light shine out of darkness,' has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" (2 Corinthians 4:6). The Holy Spirit removes the veil, opens the heart to receive the Word, and applies it powerfully to mind and conscience. The renewed soul can say, "One thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see" (John 9:25). In our information-saturated age, this spiritual illumination brings wisdom beyond mere knowledge.

### Self-Knowledge

The sinner is enlightened about his terrible condition. He discovers his heart is "desperately wicked," that he is unclean and unfit for God's presence. "Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips" (Isaiah 6:5). He sees his sins are high provocations against Heaven deserving divine judgment. In our self-esteem culture, this accurate self-assessment is both countercultural and necessary.

### Christ Revealed

The renewed soul perceives how well-suited Christ is to such a worthless wretch. The Spirit presents the infinite merits of Christ's obedience and righteousness, His compassion for sinners, and His power to save, creating desire for an interest in Christ. "No one can say 'Jesus is Lord' except in the Holy Spirit" (1 Corinthians 12:3). In our pluralistic society that views Jesus as merely one option among many, regeneration reveals Him as the only hope for sinners.

## The Effects of Regeneration: Heart Transformation

### Elevation of Affections

The Lord claims first place: "He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me" (Matthew 10:37). At regeneration, affections are taken from idols and fixed on the Lord. The once-despised Christ becomes the "altogether lovely" One (Song of Solomon 5:16), loved above all others. "Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth" (Colossians 3:2). In our entertainment-oriented culture where celebrities and influencers capture attention, regeneration reorients our affections toward Christ.

### Emancipation of the Will

By nature, man's will is free only in one direction: away from God. Sin enslaves the will, so we need to be "made free." At new birth, the will is liberated from "bondage of corruption" and rendered conformable to God's will. "For freedom Christ has set us free" (Galatians 5:1). Our culture celebrates freedom as autonomy, but true freedom comes through submission to Christ.

### Rectification of Conduct

A tree is known by its fruits. The principle of holiness manifests in godly walk: "Every one that does righteousness is born of him" (1 John 2:29). The deepest longing of God's child is to please his heavenly Father in all things. "So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God" (1 Corinthians 10:31). In our behavior-justifying society, regeneration produces a life of loving obedience rather than excuses.

## The Conflict Within the Believer

### 1. Two Opposing Principles

Though regeneration delivers from sin's dominion, the principle of sin remains. The Christian has both "flesh" and "spirit," creating internal conflict. "For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do" (Galatians 5:17). In our polarized world of external conflicts, this internal battle is often more significant.

### 2. Ongoing Struggle

The believer discovers that in his flesh dwells no good thing. Though he delights in God's law, he finds another law warring against it. "For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out" (Romans 7:18). In our self-help culture that promises easy solutions, this persistent struggle reminds us of our continued dependence on grace.

### 3. Christ's Sufficiency

The only relief is looking away from self to Christ and His perfect work. Faith empties of self-complacency and gives an exalted view of God in Christ. "But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness'" (2 Corinthians 12:9). In our achievement-oriented society, this reliance on Christ's sufficiency rather than our competency remains countercultural.

This conflict is described in Romans 7, where Paul confesses that though with his mind he serves God's law, with his flesh he serves sin's law. This causes the believer to "groan" and yearn for release from this body of death. "Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!" (Romans 7:24-25). The more one walks in God's light, the more plainly they see the flesh within, producing deeper abhorrence of their natural state. In our positivity-obsessed culture, this honest assessment of ongoing struggle is both realistic and biblical.

## Growth in Grace

Growing in grace is defined as growing "in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ" (2 Peter 3:18). It is the deepening conviction of Christ's perfect suitability for a poor sinner, realizing how much we need His blood to cleanse us, His righteousness to clothe us, His arm to support us. "But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity" (2 Peter 3:18).

Growth in grace means increasingly living outside oneself and upon Christ. The more the heart is occupied with Christ, the more faith, hope, love and other spiritual graces are strengthened. "He must increase, but I must decrease" (John 3:30). The chief evidences of spiritual growth are deepening hatred of sin, higher valuation of spiritual things, and fuller recognition of our dependency on God. In our self-actualization culture, this Christ-centered growth stands in stark contrast to self-focused development.

## Variations in Regeneration

### Different Measures of Grace

Regeneration is substantially the same in all subjects: a spiritual transformation conforming the soul to God's image. Yet God does not communicate the same measure of grace to all. His children differ as natural children do at birth, some being more vigorous than others. "Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit" (1 Corinthians 12:4). In our standardized world, this divine customization reflects God's personal attention to each believer.

### Different Manifestations

According to His sovereign pleasure, God gives some fuller knowledge, others stronger faith, others warmer affections. Natural temperament affects how the "spirit" manifests through us, but there is no difference in state - all are radically differentiated from worldlings. "For as in one body we have many members, and the members do not all have the same function, so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another" (Romans 12:4-5). In our conformist culture, these variations display God's creative diversity.

### Progressive Development

As an infant has all parts of a man yet none mature, regeneration gives perfection of parts that need development. A new life is received that must grow: "grow in grace" (2 Peter 3:18). God alone can feed and strengthen it, though we must use the means of grace. "Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation" (1 Peter 2:2). In our instant-results society, this patient, progressive development teaches us to value process as much as outcome.

## Testing the Reality of Regeneration

### 1. Heart Attitude

How does your heart respond to sin? Is there deep humiliation and godly sorrow after yielding? Is your conscience tender, disturbed by what the world calls "trifling faults"? "For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death" (2 Corinthians 7:10). In our shame-avoidant culture, this godly sorrow demonstrates spiritual sensitivity.

### 2. Mind Focus

What engages your mind in seasons of recreation? Are your affections dead toward the world and alive toward God? Do you find spiritual exercises pleasant or burdensome? "Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth" (Colossians 3:2). In our distraction-filled world, our mental focus reveals much about our spiritual state.

### 3. Ultimate Desire

Can you truthfully say, "How sweet are your words unto my taste!" (Psalm 119:103)? Is communion with God your highest joy? Is God's glory dearer to you than all the world? "Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you" (Psalm 73:25). In our pleasure-seeking society, this God-centered desire stands as evidence of divine transformation.

These questions help us examine ourselves in God's presence. The regenerate person has experienced a complete change in views, motives, inclinations, and pursuits. Though still imperfect and struggling with sin, their fundamental orientation has shifted from self to God, from earth to heaven. "Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves" (2 Corinthians 13:5). In our externally-focused world, this inward examination is essential.

## The Essence of Regeneration

Regeneration is that which alone fits a fallen creature to fulfill his chief duty: glorifying his Maker. Fallen man has departed from this chief end, making himself his primary concern rather than seeking to please God in all things. "For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself. For if we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's" (Romans 14:7-8).

The natural man is incapable of giving supreme respect to God until receiving spiritual life. None will truly aim at God's glory until they have affection for Him, and none will honor supremely whom they do not supremely love. This requires God's love to be shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Spirit. "God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us" (Romans 5:5). In our self-centered era, this God-centeredness represents the most radical paradigm shift possible.

At regeneration, self is dethroned and God enthroned. The renewed person complies with God's imperative call: "My son, give me your heart" (Proverbs 23:26). This is the essence of the new birth - a fundamental reorientation of the entire person toward God as the supreme object of love and devotion. "I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me" (Galatians 2:20). In our autonomy-celebrating culture, this divine enthronement represents true freedom and fulfillment.

## Conclusion: The Divine Purpose in Regeneration

Regeneration ultimately serves God's eternal purpose: to glorify Himself through the redemption of sinners and their transformation into the image of His Son. "For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers" (Romans 8:29).

In our modern world that exalts personal fulfillment as life's highest goal, regeneration reorients us to God's purpose, where our truest joy is found in glorifying Him. "You make known to me the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore" (Psalm 16:11).

The miracle of regeneration, though mysterious in its operation, produces visible fruit in the believer's life – love for God and others, separation from sin, devotion to Christ, and progressive conformity to His image. "By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another" (John 13:35).

Though our technological age boasts of many advancements, the human heart remains unchanged – desperately wicked and in need of divine transformation. The gospel's power to regenerate dead souls remains as necessary and effective today as in every generation. "For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes" (Romans 1:16).

May we never cease to marvel at this gracious work of God, through which He brings spiritual life from death, light from darkness, and transforms rebels into worshippers. "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light" (1 Peter 2:9).
