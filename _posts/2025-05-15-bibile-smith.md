# The Bible: Divine Truth and Salvation

## The Source of Divine Truth

The Lord Jesus Christ is the fountain of divine truth, the Holy Scriptures are its repository, the sinner's heart is its proper abode, and the Holy Spirit is its sacred revealer. The Bible contains all necessary truth, written for sinners, freely given by God so they may find everlasting peace and salvation.

The Bible was not written to gratify critics or please the imagination, but to:
- Inform the mind
- Sanctify the heart
- Direct the feet

When we read it, we should remember it is God's precious gift, meant to benefit us and glorify His name.

## The True State of Sinners

Scripture reveals our true state before God: sinners who are unworthy and in need of grace. It shows that we have fallen short of God's glory, with hearts deeply depraved. We have nothing to boast of; all we have should humble us. The Bible makes clear that salvation must be by grace alone.

## Salvation Through Faith

The Bible teaches that faith in Jesus lifts us from our lost state. It reveals:
- Divine mercy
- Infinite wisdom
- Eternal love

It presents a perfect Savior and a salvation entirely by grace, received through faith and shown by good works. This salvation:
- Meets us where we are
- Delivers us from fear
- Grants us every promise God has made

In short, the Bible tells us what we are by nature, what we become by grace, and what we will be in glory. It shows the way of escape and how God is glorified in our salvation.

## The Contents of Scripture

Scripture reveals God's purposes, promises, and precepts. It sets forth:
- God's thoughts
- Eternal secrets
- Everlasting love
- The way of salvation
- The privileges of saints
- The state and destiny of the impenitent

## The Value of God's Word

The Bible contains God's mind, reveals salvation through Christ, teaches true Christianity, and is the Christian's guide and charter. It is the casket of God's promises, the light for our path, and marks the end of both the righteous and the impenitent.

Those who reject its salvation face eternal separation from God.

## The Believer's Response
The believer sees majesty and glory in God's word. He values it deeply, seeking to:
- Know its blessings
- Enjoy its privileges
- Escape its warnings

## The true Christian:

- Learns doctrine with satisfaction
- Believes promises with joy
- Accepts invitations with gratitude
- Receives cautions with reverence
- Listens to exhortations with pleasure
- Walks by its precepts
- Reads with reverence
- Searches diligently
- Prays for the Holy Spirit's guidance

**Exhortation:**  
Do not neglect the Bible. Read it daily, pray over it, and meditate on its truths.
