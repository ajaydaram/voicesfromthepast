Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield, one of the foremost Princeton theologians after Charles Hodge, delivered this address to young men training for the ministry. While some of its language and concepts may seem dated, its core principles—that theological education should be integrated with practical Christian living and worship, and that the privilege of theological education entails great responsibilities—remain relevant to students of theology.

I have been asked to speak to you about the religious life of the student of theology. I approach this subject with some apprehension, as I consider it the most important topic we can discuss. By saying this, I do not intend to diminish the importance of intellectual preparation for the ministry. The existence of our theological seminaries is justified by the necessity of such intellectual preparation. Regardless of other gifts a person may possess, a minister must be learned to fulfill his duties. However, while learning is indispensable, it is not the most critical aspect of ministry. A minister must also be "apt to teach." This implies not only the ability to exhort, appeal, testify, or bear witness, but also to teach, which requires knowledge. Aptness to teach is essential but not sufficient for a minister. Paul lists many other qualities necessary for those aspiring to this office, and they all pertain to spiritual fitness, not intellectual prowess. Before being learned, a minister must be godly.

It would be a grave mistake to set learning and godliness against each other. Just as soldiers need both their legs, a minister needs both learning and godliness. Some suggest that ten minutes spent in prayer can give a deeper knowledge of God than ten hours spent in study. However, this implies an antagonism between learning and devotion that is fundamentally flawed. If such antagonism exists, then the intellectual life itself is cursed, and there can be no religious life for a student, even of theology. The fact that you are students of theology should indicate that you are religious men, deeply concerned with cultivating your religious life. For you, there is no "either/or"—you must be both students and men of God.

The close relationship between a theological student's work and his religious life should be emphasized. While you may not consider religion and study incompatible, you might be tempted to compartmentalize them, keeping your studies separate from your religious life. This would be a gross mistake. Religion does not detract from your work; it enhances it with added devotion. As George Herbert wrote, even the meanest work can be glorified if done for God's sake. This concept, known as the doctrine of vocation, teaches that the best service to God is to do your duty, whatever it may be, with all your heart. Protestantism rejected the medieval notion of separating the religious and secular lives, recognizing that every vocation, no matter how humble, is of divine right.

As students of theology, your vocation is to study theology diligently, as if doing it for the Lord. Your religious life depends fundamentally on faithfully performing your daily duties. A religious life cannot be built on neglected duty. While it is wrong for a theological student not to study, it does not necessarily follow that everything is right with his religious life if he does study. It is possible to study, even theology, in a purely secular spirit. However, this is only possible for an irreligious or unreligious person. As students of theology, you are constantly brought into the presence of God through your studies. Can a religious person stand in God's presence and not worship? If you do not approach your studies as religious exercises, there may be something wrong with your spiritual condition. Rejoice if you do, but strive to do so ever more abundantly. Put your heart into your studies, not just your mind, for they bring you into the presence of God and should be approached with reverence and devotion.

Now, as students of theology, your vocation is to study theology diligently, following the apostolic injunction: "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord." This is why you are students of theology; this is your "next duty," and neglecting this duty does not contribute to a fruitful religious life. Dr. Charles Hodge, in his delightful autobiographical notes, recounts the advice of Philip Lindsay, the most popular professor at Princeton College in his day—a man sought by nearly every college in the Central States for its presidency. Lindsay told their class that one of the best preparations for death was a thorough knowledge of Greek grammar. Dr. Hodge comments on this in his quaint way, saying that this was Lindsay's way of telling them to do their duty. Every person who aspires to be religious must begin by doing their duty— their obvious duty, their daily task, the specific work before them at this particular time and place. If this work happens to be studying, then their religious life fundamentally depends on just studying. It is as absurd to talk of a father neglecting his parental duties, a son failing in filial piety, an artisan skimping on his work, or a workman being nothing more than an eye-servant and being religious men, as it is to talk of a student who does not study being a religious man. It cannot be: you cannot build up a religious life except by faithfully performing your simple, daily duties. It is not a question of whether you like these duties. You may think what you please of your studies. You may consider that you are singing precisely of them when you sing of 'even servile labors' and 'the meanest work.' But you must faithfully devote yourselves to your studies if you wish to be religious men. No religious character can be built on the foundation of neglected duty.

There is certainly something wrong with the religious life of a theological student who does not study. But it does not quite follow that everything is right with his religious life if he does study. It is possible to study—even to study theology—in an entirely secular spirit. I said earlier that religion sends a man to his work with an added quality of devotion. By this, I mean that devotion should be understood in both its senses— as zealous application and as a religious exercise. A truly religious man will study anything that becomes his duty to study with devotion in both of these senses. This is what religion does for him: it makes him do his duty thoroughly, with zeal, and "as to the Lord." However, in many branches of study, there is nothing in the topics studied that directly feeds the religious life or evokes religious emotions or reactions. If we study them "as to the Lord," it is only because we do it "for his sake," on the principle that makes "sweeping a room" an act of worship. With theology, it is different. In all its branches, theology aims to make God known. The student of theology is brought by his daily task into the presence of God and is kept there. Can a religious man stand in the presence of God and not worship? It is possible. I said earlier that it is possible to study even theology in a purely secular spirit. But surely, that is possible only for an irreligious man, or at least for an unreligious man. Here I offer you a test by which you may discern your religious state and a means for the quickening of your religious life. Do you approach your daily tasks as students of theology as religious exercises? If you do not, examine yourselves: the spiritual condition of a person who can engage daily with divine things with a cold and impassive heart is surely not right. If you do, rejoice. But in any case, ensure that you do! And do it more and more abundantly. Make all your theological studies "religious exercises." This is the great rule for a rich and wholesome religious life in a theological student. Put your heart into your studies: do not merely engage your mind with them, but put your heart into them. They bring you daily and hourly into the very presence of God; his ways, his dealings with men, the infinite majesty of his Being form their subject matter. Take off your shoes in this holy presence!

We are often told that the great danger for the theological student lies in his constant contact with divine things. They may become common to him because they are customary. Just as the average person breathes air and basks in the sunshine without considering that it is God who provides these things, the theological student may handle even the objects of worship without acknowledging their divine significance. The words describing God's majesty or goodness may become mere words to him, with their linguistic nuances and grammatical structures. The arguments establishing the mysteries of God's saving activities may become mere logical constructs, with premises and conclusions, logically sound but lacking deeper significance. God's actions in redemptive history may become a series of historical facts, influencing social and religious conditions and pointing to a shrewdly conjectured outcome. This is your great danger. But it is your great danger only because it is your great privilege. Consider what a privilege it is when your greatest danger is that the great things of religion may become common to you! Other people, burdened by the hardships of life, engrossed in the daily struggle for sustenance, distracted by the world's demands, find it difficult to find time to consider the existence of God, religion, and salvation from sin. Your life's atmosphere is filled with these things; you breathe them in at every moment. They surround you, envelop you, press in on you from all sides. You are at risk of growing weary of God!

Do you understand this danger? Or, rather, let us ask—are you aware of your privileges? Are you fully utilizing them? Are you, through this constant contact with divine things, growing in holiness, becoming more and more men of God? If not, you are hardening! And I am here today to warn you to take your theological study seriously, not only as a duty done for God's sake and therefore divine but also as a religious exercise, itself charged with religious blessing to you. It is suited by its nature to fill your mind, heart, soul, and life with divine thoughts, feelings, aspirations, and achievements. I am not advising you to make your theological studies your only religious exercises. They are indeed religious exercises of the most rewarding kind, and your religious life depends greatly on treating them as such. However, there are other religious exercises that require your punctual attention and cannot be neglected without serious damage to your religious life. I am specifically referring to the regular formal religious meetings of the seminary community. I want to be perfectly clear and emphatic about this. No one can withdraw from the regular religious services of the community of which they are a part without serious harm to their personal religious life. It is significant that the apostolic writer connects the exhortations to "hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering" and "not forsaking our own assembling together." When he commands us not to forsake "our assembling together," he means the regular, formal gatherings of the community and intends to impress upon his readers their duty to the church of which they are members, as well as their duty to themselves. By adding, "as is the habit of some," he is emphasizing the importance of this command. Who are these people who are so strong, so holy, that they do not need the support of common worship for themselves, and who, being so strong and holy, will not contribute to the common worship?

However important common worship is for everyone, its importance for a group of young men like yourselves is incomparable. You are gathered here for a religious purpose, preparing for the highest religious service that men can perform—guiding others in the religious life. Shall you have everything else in common except worship? You are gathered here, separated from your homes and all that they mean, from the churches in which you were raised and all that church fellowship means, from all the powerful influences of social religion—and yet, you will not form a religious community yourselves, with its own organic religious life and expression? I say this deliberately: a group of young men, living together in a community as you are and must be, cannot maintain a healthy, full, rich religious life individually unless they give organic expression to their religious life as a community in frequent, regular sessions of common worship. Nothing can replace this common, organic worship of the community as a community, at its regular times, and as a regular function of the community's corporate life. Without it, you cease to be a religious community and lack the support, encouragement, and motivation that come from the organic life of the community of which you are a part.

In an institution like this, I am quite clear that the whole body of students should come together, both morning and evening, every day, for common prayer. They should also join twice on every Sabbath in formal worship. Without at least this much common worship, I do not think the institution can preserve its character as a distinctively religious institution, one whose institutional life is primarily a religious one. And I do not think that the individual students gathered here can, with less full expression of the organic religious life of the institution, preserve the high level of religious life on which, as students of theology, they ought to live. You will observe that I am not merely exhorting you to go to church. Going to church is good in any case. But what I am exhorting you to do is to go to your own church, to give your presence and active religious participation to every stated meeting for worship of the institution as an institution. Thus, you will do your part to give the institution an organic religious life, and you will draw out from the organic religious life of the institution a support and inspiration for your own personal religious life which you cannot get anywhere else, and which you cannot afford to miss if, that is, you have a care to your religious quickening and growth. To be an active member of a living religious body is the condition of healthy religious functioning.

I trust you will not tell me that the stated religious exercises of the Seminary are too numerous, or are wearying. That would only be to betray the low ebb of your own religious vitality. The feet of him whose heart is warm with religious feeling turn of themselves to the sanctuary and carry him with joyful steps to the house of prayer. I am told that there are some students who do not find themselves in a prayerful mood in the early hours of a winter morning, and are much too tired at the close of a hard day’s work to pray, and therefore do not find it profitable to attend prayers in the late afternoon. They think the preaching at the regular service on Sabbath morning dull and uninteresting, and they do not find Christ at the Sabbath afternoon conference. Such things I seem to have heard before, and yours will be an exceptional pastorate if you do not hear something very like them before you have been in a pastorate six months. Such things meet you every day on the street: they are the ordinary expression of the heart which is dulled or is dulling to the religious appeal. They are not hopeful symptoms among those whose life should be lived on the religious heights. No doubt, those who minister to you in spiritual things should take them to heart. And you who are ministered to must take them to heart, too. And let me tell you straight out that the preaching you find dull will no more seem dull to you if you faithfully obey the Master’s precept: ‘Take heed how ye hear’: that if you do not find Christ in the conference room it is because you do not take him there with you; that if after an ordinary day’s work you are too weary to unite with your fellows in closing the day with common prayer, it is because the impulse to prayer is weak in your heart. If there is no fire in the pulpit, it falls to you to kindle it in the pews. No man can fail to meet with God in the sanctuary if he takes God there with him.

How easy it is to roll the blame of our cold hearts over upon the shoulders of our religious leaders! It is refreshing to observe how Luther, with his breezy good sense, dealt with complaints of lack of attractiveness in his evangelical preachers. He had not sent them out to please people, he said, and their function was not to interest or to entertain: their function was to teach the saving truth of God, and, if they did that, it was frivolous for people in danger of perishing for want of the truth to object to the vessel in which it was offered to them. When the people of Torgau, for instance, wished to dismiss their pastors, because, they said, their voices were too weak to fill the churches, Luther simply responded. That’s an old song; better have some difficulty in hearing the gospel than no difficulty at all in hearing what is very far from the gospel’. ‘People cannot have their ministers exactly as they wish’, he declares again, ‘they should thank God for the pure word’, and not demand St. Augustines and St. Ambroses to preach it to them. If a pastor pleases the Lord Jesus and is faithful to him,—there is none so great and mighty but he ought to be pleased with him, too. The point, you see, is that men who are hungry for the truth and get it ought not to be exigent as to the platter in which it is served to them. And they will not be.

But why should we appeal to Luther? Have we not the example of our Lord Jesus Christ? Are we better than he? Surely, if ever there was one who might justly plead that the common worship of the community had nothing to offer him it was the Lord Jesus Christ. But every Sabbath found him seated in his place among the worshipping people and there was no act of stated worship which he felt himself entitled to discard. Even in his most exalted moods and after his most elevating experiences, he quietly took his place with the rest of God’s people sharing with them in the common worship of the community. ‘It is a reminder’, as Sir William Robertson Nicoll well insists, ‘of the truth which, in our fancied spirituality, we are apt to forget—that the holiest personal life can scarcely afford to dispense with stated forms of devotion, and that the regular public worship of the church, for all its local imperfections and dullness, is a divine provision for sustaining the individual soul’. ‘We cannot afford to be wiser than our Lord in this matter. If any one could have pled that his spiritual experience was so lofty that it did not require public worship. if any one might have felt that the consecration and communion of his personal life exempted him from what ordinary mortals needed, it was Jesus. But he made no such plea. Sabbath by Sabbath even he was found in the place of worship, side by side with God’s people, not for the mere sake of setting a good example, but for deeper reasons. Is it reasonable, then, that any of us should think we can safely afford to dispense with the pious custom of regular participation with the common worship of our locality? Is it necessary for me to exhort those who would fain be like Christ, to see to it that they are imitators of him in this?

But not even with the most assiduous use of the corporate expressions of the religious life of the community have you reached the foundation-stone of your piety. That is to be found, of course, in your closets, or rather in your hearts, in your private religious exercises, and in your intimate religious aspirations. You are here as theological students: and if you would be religious men, you must do your duty as theological students: you must find daily nourishment for your religious life in your theological studies: you must enter fully into the organic religious life of the community of which you form a part. But to do all this you must keep the fires of religious life burning brightly in your heart; in the in

most core of your being, you must be men of God. Time would fail me, if I undertook to outline with any fullness the method of the devout life. Every soul seeking God honestly and earnestly finds him, and in finding him, finds the way to him. One hint I may give you, particularly adapted to you as students for the ministry: keep always before your mind the greatness of your calling, that is to say, these two things: the immensity of the task before you, the infinitude of the resources at your disposal. I think it has not been idly said that if we face the tremendous difficulty of the work before us, it will certainly throw us back upon our knees; and if we worthily gauge the power of the gospel committed to us, that will certainly keep us on our knees. I am led to single out this particular consideration, because it seems to me that we have fallen upon an age in which we very greatly need to recall ourselves to the seriousness of life and its issues and to the seriousness of our calling as ministers to life. Sir Oliver Lodge informs us that ‘men of culture are not bothering’, nowadays, ‘about their sins, much less about their punishment’, and Dr Johnston Ross preaches us a much needed homily from that text on the ‘lightheartedness of the modern religious quest’. In a time like this, it is perhaps not strange that careful observers of the life of our Theological Seminaries tell us that the most noticeable thing about it is a certain falling off from the intense seriousness of outlook by which students of theology were formerly characterised. Let us hope it is not true, If it were true, it would be a great evil; so far as it is true, it is a great evil. I would call you back to this seriousness of outlook, and bid you cultivate it, if you would be men of God now and ministers who need not be ashamed hereafter. Think of the greatness of the minister’s calling; the greatness of the issues which hang on your worthiness or your unworthiness for its high functions; and determine once for all that with God’s help you will be worthy. ‘God had but one Son’, says Thomas Goodwin, ‘and he made him a minister’. ‘None but he who made the world’, says John Newton, ‘can make a minister’—that is, a minister who is worthy.

You can, of course, be a minister of a sort, and not be God-made. You can go through the motions of the work, and I shall not say that your work will be in vain—for God is good and who knows by what instruments he may work his will of good for men? Helen Jackson pictures far too common an experience when she paints the despair of one whose sowing, though not unfruitful for others, bears no harvest in his own soul.

O teacher, then I said, thy years,

Are they not joy? each word that issueth

From out thy lips, doth it return to bless

Thine own heart manyfold?

Listen to the response:

I starve with hunger treading out their corn,

I die of travail while their souls are born.

She does not mean it in quite the evil part in which I am reading it. But what does Paul mean when he utters that terrible warning: ‘Lest when I have preached to others. I myself should be a castaway?’. And there is an even more dreadful contingency. It is our Saviour himself who tells us that it is possible to compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when we have made him, to make him twofold more a child of hell than we are ourselves. And will we not be in awful peril of making our proselytes children of hell if we are not ourselves children of heaven? Even physical waters will not rise above their source: the spiritual floods are even less tractable to our commands. There is no mistake more terrible than to suppose that activity in Christian work can take the place of depth of Christian affections.

This is why many good men are concerned today about a tendency they see among our younger Christian workers toward restless activity at the apparent expense of depth of spiritual culture. Activity, of course, is good; surely in the cause of the Lord, we should run and not be weary. But not when it substitutes for inner religious strength. We cannot get along without our Marthas. But what shall we do when, through all the length and breadth of the land, we shall search in vain for a Mary? Of course, the Marthas will be as little admired by the Marys today as of yore. ‘Lord,’ cried Martha, ‘dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone?’. And from that time to this, the cry has continually gone up against the Marys that they waste the precious ointment which might have been given to the poor, when they pour it out to God and are idle when they sit at the Master’s feet. A minister, high in the esteem of the churches, is even quoted as declaring—not confessing, mind you, but publishing abroad as something in which he gloried—that he has long since ceased to pray: he works. ‘Work and pray’ is no longer, it seems, to be the motto of at least ministerial life. It is to be all work and no praying: the only prayer that is prevailing, we are told, with the sad cynicism with which we are told that God is on the side of the largest battalions—is just work. You will say this is an extreme case. Thank God, it is. But in the tendencies of our modern life, which all make for ceaseless—I had almost said thoughtless, meaningless—activity, have a care that it does not become your case; or that your case—even now—may not have at least some resemblance to it. Do you pray? How much do you pray? How much do you love to pray? What place in your life does the ‘still hour’, alone with God, take?

I am sure that if you once get a true glimpse of what the ministry of the cross is, for which you are preparing, and of what you, as men preparing for this ministry, should be, you will pray. Lord, who is sufficient for these things, your heart will cry; and your whole soul will be wrung with the petition: Lord, make me sufficient for these things. Old Cotton Mather wrote a great little book once, to serve as a guide to students for the ministry. The not very happy title which he gave it is Manductio ad Ministerium. But by a stroke of genius, he added a sub-title which is more significant. And this is the sub-title he added: The angels preparing to sound the trumpets. That is what Cotton Mather calls you, students for the ministry: the angels, preparing to sound the trumpets! Take the name to yourselves, and live up to it. Give your days and nights to living up to it! And then, perhaps, when you come to sound the trumpets, the note will be pure and clear and strong, and perchance may pierce even to the grave and wake the dead.
