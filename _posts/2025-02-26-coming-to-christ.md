# Coming to Christ: A Spiritual Journey by A.W Pink, Daram Ajay

The journey to Christ is not a simple physical act or mental decision, but a profound spiritual transformation that penetrates the deepest parts of our being. It requires divine intervention, as Jesus Himself declared, "No man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw him" (John 6:44). This presentation explores the multifaceted nature of coming to Christ - examining the obstacles we face in our fallen state, how our understanding, affections, and will are involved in this supernatural work, and how to discern and validate genuine conversion in an age of religious superficiality.

## The Paradox of Coming to Christ

### The Invitation
"Come unto me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28). Christ extends His gracious invitation to those who recognize their spiritual burden and inability to save themselves. In our modern context of burnout, anxiety, and digital exhaustion, this invitation speaks with renewed power to weary souls seeking authentic peace.

### The Impossibility
"No man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw him" (John 6:44). Despite this universal invitation, no fallen human can respond without divine enablement. Coming to Christ is impossible for natural man, whose mind is "hostile to God" (Romans 8:7) and whose heart is "deceitful above all things, and desperately sick" (Jeremiah 17:9). Our technological advances and educational achievements have not overcome this spiritual inability.

### The Promise
"All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and him that comes to me I will in no wise cast out" (John 6:37). God's sovereign election ensures that His chosen ones will come to Christ, and Christ will never reject them. "For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son" (Romans 8:29). This promise stands firm across all cultures and generations, offering unshakable hope to believers facing a world of uncertainty.

## The Demanding Terms of Discipleship

### 1. Radical Reordering of Affections
"If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple" (Luke 14:26). Christ demands supreme love that makes all other loves seem like hatred by comparison. "He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me" (Matthew 10:37). In an age of divided loyalties and conflicting priorities, Christ calls for a revolutionary reordering of our attachments and devotions.

### 2. Complete Self-Denial
"And whoever does not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple" (Luke 14:27). The cross represents self-sacrifice and suffering willingly embraced for Christ's sake. Following Christ means dying to self-interest and worldly ambitions. "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me" (Galatians 2:20). In a culture obsessed with self-fulfillment and personal autonomy, the call to self-denial stands as a radical counterpoint.

### 3. Continual Coming
"To whom coming, as unto a living stone" (1 Peter 2:4). Coming to Christ is not a one-time event but a continuous action, an ongoing relationship of dependence and devotion. We must draw from His fullness daily, constantly turning to Him for all our needs. "Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me" (John 15:4). Our digital age of constant distraction makes this continual communion both more challenging and more essential.

## Obstacles in Coming to Christ

### Not a Lack of Faculties
The inability lies not in lacking necessary faculties. Fallen man possesses the same physical and mental capabilities as before the Fall. He has eyes to read Scripture, feet to attend worship, and mental capacity to consider eternal matters. This makes him "without excuse" (Romans 1:20). Today's information age has made biblical knowledge more accessible than ever, yet spiritual blindness persists.

### A Corrupt Nature
The real obstacle is man's depraved nature. Like a vulture preferring carrion to grain despite having the same physical ability to eat either, unregenerate man rejects Christ because his nature is opposed to holiness. "Adam begat a son in his own likeness" (Genesis 5:3). "That which is born of the flesh is flesh" (John 3:6). Despite advances in education and technology, human nature remains unchanged at its core.

### Darkened Understanding
Scripture declares "there is none that understands" (Romans 3:11). Sin has closed the windows of the soul, covering the mind with darkness. The unregenerate are not merely "in darkness" but are "darkness itself" (Ephesians 5:8). "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned" (1 Corinthians 2:14). This explains why brilliant secular minds often find the gospel foolish.

## More Obstacles to Overcome

### Corrupted Affections
The natural man loves anything and everything above spiritual things. "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked" (Jeremiah 17:9). Our affections are misplaced - we love what we should hate and hate what we should love. "For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud..." (2 Timothy 3:2). Social media's emphasis on self-promotion has only amplified these disordered affections.

### Enslaved Will
The human will is "desperately set on mischief, so depraved, and so inclined to everything that is evil, and so disinclined to everything that is good." Jesus declared, "You will not come to me that you might have life" (John 5:40). The will is not morally neutral but actively opposed to God. "Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be" (Romans 8:7). This explains humanity's persistent rebellion despite growing knowledge.

### The Threefold Cord
"A blind mind, a perverse will, and disorderly, distempered affections" form a threefold cord against Heaven and holiness. The mind says the man should not stoop; the corrupt affections rise against the Lord in defense of the corrupt will. "The god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not" (2 Corinthians 4:4). This threefold bondage explains why mere education or moral reform cannot produce salvation.

## What Does "Coming to Christ" Mean?

### Not a Physical Act
Coming to Christ is not performed with bodily members. It is not walking to an altar, raising a hand, or taking a preacher's hand. These physical actions may express an inward reality, but they are not themselves the coming. "God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth" (John 4:24). In our ritual-focused religious culture, this distinction is critical.

### A Spiritual Movement
Coming to Christ is a metaphorical expression denoting the movement of a Spirit-enlightened mind toward the Lord Jesus - as Prophet to be instructed by Him, as Priest whose atonement is relied upon, and as King to be ruled by Him. "For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father" (Ephesians 2:18). This spiritual movement transcends our physical limitations and geographical distances.

### Complete Surrender
It involves turning from the world to Christ as our only Hope, abandoning every idol and dependency, with the heart going out to Him in loving submission and trustful confidence. It is the will surrendering to His Lordship. "Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out" (Acts 3:19). In an age of endless options and alternatives, this exclusive commitment to Christ stands as a radical, countercultural choice.

### Whole Soul to Whole Christ
Coming to Christ means the turning of the whole soul unto a whole Christ in the exercise of Divine grace - the mind, heart and will being supernaturally drawn to Him, to trust, love and serve Him. "You shall seek me, and find me, when you shall search for me with all your heart" (Jeremiah 29:13). This totality of commitment challenges our compartmentalized approach to life and faith.

## Coming to Christ with Our Understanding

### Knowledge is Essential
There can be no movement toward an unknown object. "How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?" (Romans 10:14). We must have some acquaintance with Christ before we can trust or love Him. Knowledge of Christ must precede believing in Him. "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3). In our information-saturated age, true knowledge of Christ stands apart from mere religious data.

### Knowledge Comes from Scripture
Nothing can be known of Christ save what God has revealed in His Word. "Search the Scriptures...they are they which testify of me" (John 5:39). Where the Scriptures have not gone, Christ is unknown - proof that knowledge of Him requires divine revelation. "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness" (2 Timothy 3:16). This biblical foundation challenges the subjective spirituality prevalent today.

### Theoretical Knowledge is Insufficient
Head-knowledge about Christ is not the same as heart-acquaintance with Him. One may have a sound doctrinal understanding yet lack saving faith. "They have the form of knowledge and of the truth" (Romans 2:20) without its power. "Even the demons believeâ€”and tremble!" (James 2:19). This distinction is crucial in academic religious settings where intellectual mastery of theology can substitute for genuine faith.

## Spiritual vs. Natural Knowledge

### Natural Knowledge
Natural knowledge of Christ is partial, occasional, weak, and does not transform the possessor. It may involve correct doctrine but lacks spiritual power. Like studying music theory without hearing the symphony, it misses the experiential reality. "Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof" (2 Timothy 3:5). This explains why religious education alone cannot produce spiritual transformation.

### Spiritual Knowledge
Spiritual knowledge is imparted by the Holy Spirit. "We know that the Son of God is come, and has given us an understanding" (1 John 5:20). It is impartial, regular, powerful, and transforms the life of its possessor. "But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you" (1 John 2:27). This supernatural illumination transcends human teaching and intellectual capacity.

### Transformative Effects
Spiritual knowledge fires the affections, sanctifies the will, and raises the mind to fixation on Christ. It produces faith, love, and submission. It causes the soul to exclaim, "Whom have I in Heaven but you?" (Psalm 73:25). "For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" (2 Corinthians 4:6). This transformation manifests in changed priorities and renewed motivations.

## Coming to Christ with Our Affections

### Heart Transformation
When the Holy Spirit regenerates a person, He not only renews the understanding but radically changes the heart. "A new heart also will I give you" (Ezekiel 36:26). This miracle of grace turns the heart from the world to Christ. "I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts" (Hebrews 8:10). In an emotionally volatile culture, this stable transformation of heart provides an anchor for authentic spiritual life.

### Love Follows Light
"When faith gives us a sight of spiritual things, the heart is warmed with love to them." The order is important: first spiritual knowledge, then faith, then love. "We have known and believed the love that God has to us" (1 John 4:16). "We love him, because he first loved us" (1 John 4:19). This sequence challenges both intellectualism that stops at knowledge and emotionalism that bypasses truth.

### Love's Centrality
Scripture emphasizes love as much as belief: "If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema" (1 Corinthians 16:22). "All things work together for good to them that love God" (Romans 8:28). Saving faith always produces love. "Faith worketh by love" (Galatians 5:6). In a culture that often reduces Christianity to moral behavior or doctrinal positions, love's centrality reminds us of faith's relational essence.

## The Spirit's Drawing of the Heart

### Divine Attraction
God draws sinners "with cords of a man, with bands of love" (Hosea 11:4) - not by external force but by spiritual influence moving their inward faculties. "No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him" (John 6:44). This supernatural attraction works harmoniously with human faculties while overcoming their corruption.

### Revealing Christ's Beauty
The Spirit shows there is infinitely more goodness in Christ than in the creature, winning hearts by communicating a powerful sense of His superlative excellency. "One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD" (Psalm 27:4). This spiritual sight outshines the world's competing attractions and empty promises.

### Creating Precious Esteem
To believers, Christ becomes "precious" (1 Peter 2:7) - so precious they willingly part with everything to "win Christ" (Philippians 3:8). "The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field" (Matthew 13:44). This radical revaluation exposes the emptiness of worldly treasures and redirects our desires toward lasting riches.

## Coming to Christ with Our Will

### Understanding Enlightened
The mind perceives Christ's glory. "Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law" (Psalm 119:18). The Spirit removes spiritual blindness and reveals the beauty and necessity of Christ. "For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" (2 Corinthians 4:6).

### Affections Stirred
The heart values Christ above all. "Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth" (Colossians 3:2). The Spirit awakens spiritual desires and creates a hunger for righteousness. "As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God" (Psalm 42:1). These awakened affections provide the motivational energy for genuine conversion.

### Willing Consent
The will freely consents to Christ's terms. The will is the last faculty to be conquered in conversion. No sinner savingly comes to Christ until the will freely consents to His self-denying terms. This happens only after the understanding has been supernaturally enlightened and the affections supernaturally quickened. The Spirit overcomes the resistance of indwelling sin and creates desires for Christ.

As Psalm 110:3 declares, "Your people shall be willing in the day of your power." Yet though Divine power is exerted, the Spirit does not infringe the will's freedom but morally persuades it, subduing its sinful resistance and winning it by the sweet attractions of grace. "For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure" (Philippians 2:13). This willing surrender marks true conversion in every generation.

## The Miracle of Conversion: Ruth's Example

### Counting the Cost
Naomi faithfully warned of difficulties ahead. "But Naomi said, 'Turn back, my daughters; why will you go with me?'" (Ruth 1:11). True spiritual guides always present the full cost of discipleship. "For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?" (Luke 14:28). This honest assessment challenges the easy-believism prevalent in contemporary evangelism.

### Superficial Departure
Orpah's "goodness" quickly vanished. "Then they lifted up their voices and wept again. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her" (Ruth 1:14). Many make promising starts but turn back when faced with sacrifice. "They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away" (Luke 8:13). This pattern repeats itself in every generation.

### Wholehearted Commitment
Ruth's supernatural devotion prevailed. "For where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God my God" (Ruth 1:16). Ruth's conversion beautifully illustrates true coming to Christ. She freely left her country, kindred, and idolatry to follow the true God. She renounced all that flesh holds dear, counting everything loss for His sake. This was no natural decision but God working in her "both to will and to do of his good pleasure" (Philippians 2:13). Every genuine conversion involves this complete surrender of mind, heart, and will to God.

## False Signs of Coming to Christ

Many mistake these common experiences for true conversion:

### Sound Doctrine
Mere intellectual assent to orthodox theology cannot save. "You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believeâ€”and shudder!" (James 2:19). Doctrinal correctness, while important, is insufficient without heart transformation.

### Absence of Doubts
Baseless confidence may indicate presumption rather than faith. "There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death" (Proverbs 14:12). False assurance often comes from never having deeply examined one's spiritual state.

### Emotional Response
Temporary feelings do not constitute lasting change. "For as he thinks in his heart, so is he" (Proverbs 23:7). Tears, excitement, or other emotional reactions may accompany true conversion but cannot substitute for it.

### Fear of Hell
Mere dread of punishment differs from hatred of sin itself. "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom" (Proverbs 9:10), but it must progress to love. Many seek escape from hell without desiring Christ Himself.

### False Peace
Superficial comfort comes when one clutches at promises without heart transformation. "They have healed the wound of my people lightly, saying, 'Peace, peace,' when there is no peace" (Jeremiah 6:14). This counterfeit peace lacks the deep joy of genuine reconciliation with God.

### Self-Confidence
Pride can masquerade as spiritual assurance. "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us" (1 John 1:8). True faith produces humility and dependence, not self-righteousness.

### Resting on Promises
Claiming biblical promises without embracing Christ Himself leaves one empty. "You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me, yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life" (John 5:39-40). Christ, not the Bible alone, is the object of saving faith.

## True Signs of Coming to Christ

### Burdened by Sin
Do they cry out at sin, being burdened with it, as an exceedingly bitter thing? Do they flee from it as from the face of a deadly serpent? True converts see sin as their greatest enemy, not merely fearing its consequences but hating its nature. "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" (Romans 7:24). This godly sorrow leads to genuine repentance.

### Valuing Christ Above All
Do they see more worth in one drop of Christ's blood than in all the world's pleasures? Are they willing to leave all for His sake? True converts esteem Christ as infinitely precious, counting all else as loss compared to knowing Him. "I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord" (Philippians 3:8). This supreme valuation of Christ transforms priorities and choices.

### Love for Christ's People
Are Christ's saints precious to them? Do they favor Christ in this world and run hazards for His name? True converts love what Christ loves and are willing to suffer for His sake. They demonstrate tender affection for fellow believers. "We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren" (1 John 3:14). This supernatural love crosses cultural, economic, and social barriers.

As John Bunyan wrote, these signs reveal those truly coming to Christ. They see their own righteousness as insufficient, cry out to Jesus to save them, and become tender about sinning against Him. Their faith produces tangible fruits of love and devotion. "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another" (John 13:35).

## The Sovereign Work of Grace

Coming to Christ is ultimately God's sovereign work of grace. Christ is not offered by men but is "the unspeakable Gift of the Father to as many as He has ordained to eternal life." The Holy Spirit supernaturally reveals and applies Christ to the heirs of salvation "when, where, and as He pleases; and not when, where, and how men please."

This supernatural work transforms the understanding, affections, and will. It overcomes our natural resistance and creates in us a new heart that desires Christ. "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast" (Ephesians 2:8-9).

As Jesus promised, "All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and him that comes to me I will in no wise cast out" (John 6:37). Those who truly come to Christ are eternally secure, for "He ever lives to make intercession for them" (Hebrews 7:25). "Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ" (Philippians 1:6).

In our modern world of spiritual confusion and competing voices, this understanding of coming to Christ provides clarity and hope. It humbles human pride, exalts divine grace, and offers assurance to those who have experienced this supernatural work in their own hearts. "Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen" (Jude 24-25).
