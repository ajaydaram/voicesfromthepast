<p>Hi there, I’m Ajay — a follower of Jesus, theology student, and a lifelong learner in the school of grace.</p>

<p>Welcome to my devotional blog — a space where I share reflections from Scripture, insights from my studies, and devotions from both the present and the past. Here, you’ll find thoughts freshly written during quiet times, as well as older devotions that continue to speak to my heart. I believe God’s Word is timeless, and even past reflections can breathe new life into our walk with Him today.</p>

<p>I’m currently studying theology, with a heart for cross-cultural ministry, biblical teaching, and grounding the next generation in truth and grace. Whether I’m writing from a dorm room, a church pew, or in the quiet of a library, my aim remains the same: to point others to Christ.</p>

<p>This blog is a collection of devotionals, theological reflections, and moments of worship written in response to God’s faithfulness. Some posts may come from seasons of clarity, others from times of wrestling — but all are testimonies of God’s unchanging goodness.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a place to slow down, meditate on Scripture, and grow deeper in Christ — I pray this space blesses you.</p>

<p><b>Let the Word dwell richly.</b></p>
<p>Let grace lead us home.</p>

<p>With you on the journey,</p>
<p>Ajay<p>
<p>Soli Deo Gloria</p>
